# XGB-with-PCA-DWT by 

Simpler replication of a paper of Jo√£o Nobreand Rui Ferreira Neves, realized by me and other two components of my university students club.
Without entering in to the effective econometric meaning of the research, we tried to use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of a large dataset and filter out the noise using DWT.
The forecast of the next day close is realized using an XGB model enhanced by a genetic algoritmh optimization.

This code has to be viewed as an activity made for fun and not a professional code or an investment raccomentdation. 

Huge thanks to Alessio Battilocchi and Alessandro Dipierro that helped me trough the various steps of the realization.
